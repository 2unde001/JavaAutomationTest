#### Element locator stratergy.
Driver need to interact with the page element in order to perform or automate a website.

This element(s) are HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) used by developer to develop a webite .


We can locate page element using several locators such as:
- Locate element by id
- Locate element by classname
- Locate element by cssSelector
- Locate element by name
- Locate element by xpath
- Locate element tby linkText

Note: 
I'm using **Thread.sleep()** method to let the Dom(document object model) to settle down - lett the page pull all the elelments before procedding to the next action.
I will use more implicit and explicit wait laterin the section.
